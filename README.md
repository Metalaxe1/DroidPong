# _Droid Pong v1.0_ 

# Project Goal:
Gain a better understanding of Android animation from the re-creation of a childhood favorite.

# Description:
Droid Pong moves a ball within court boundaries challenging users to return the volley.  It currently only supports single player but future work will include Head-To-Head play and server supported multi-player.
